## Introduction

The cryptocurrency market is a center of a lot of activity. It is a growing market with much potential and profit. Data science is used in cryptocurrency to forecast and predict the prices of these digital coins. This science is used to figure out what causes the changes in prices of the coins, and then indictaes whether the prices will increase or decrease in the future. By focusing on market capitalization, or the coins' worth, one will predict how well or poorly a cryptocurrency will perform. 

In this project, TABD will be focusing on 5 different cryptocurrencies and their overall performance, specifically: Bitcoin, Dogecoin, Litecoin, Ripple and Ethereum. After running parsed data into specific machine learning algorithms, our goal is obtain predictions whether it is a good time to buy or sell a specific cryptocurrency or not. In addition, we will be able to determine which kind of crypto market the data falls under, whether is it a bull, bear, or neutral market.

Two years data was analyzed and averaged by weekday to see if there were any trends for high/low days. 

## Criteria for whether the user should invest:
### Is it a bull, bear, or neutral market?
  
#### Bull Market Criteria: 
1) Has Bitcoin price increased by over 70% in the past 3 months, and 150% in the past 6 months?
2) Has the asset in question increased by over 70% in the past 3 months, and over 200% in the past 6 months?

#### Bear Market Criteria:
1) Has Bitcoin price decreased by over 40% in the past 3 months, and 60% in the past 6 months? 
2) Has the asset in question decreased by over 40% in the past 3 months and over 60% in the past 6 months?
**For the above, if both 1 and 2, then highly likely bull market / bear market. If only 1, then somewhat likely bull market / bear market. If only 2, then it may indicate project growth or failure but not a true bull market / bear market. 

#### Neutral Market Criteria:
1) Has Bitcoin price stayed within a 70% range over the past 3 months, and neither increased or decreased more than 150% in the past 6 months? 
2) Has the asset in question stayed within a 70% range over the past 3 month, and neither increased or decreased more than 150% in the past 6 months?
* * If none of the above are true for bull, bear, or neutral market criteria, then it is too difficult to predict the market type

## The Process

#### Topic
Cryptocurrencies â€“ multiple types
#### Original Idea
What type of market? 
Is it a good time to invest?
Is it a good time to sell?  
Are there any particular trends that may be relevant?
